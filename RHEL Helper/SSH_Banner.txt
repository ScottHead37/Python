#------ Pre-Login Banner Issue / Solution  -----------
How to troubleshoot: (When /etc/issue does not work)

Check the sshd_config file:
Open the file: sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Search for the line containing "Banner": Banner /etc/ssh/sshd-banner

If the line is missing or commented out, add it with the correct path to your banner file.

Verify banner file content:
Open the banner file: sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd-banner

Ensure the text you want displayed as the banner is present in the file.

Restart SSH service:
Run sudo systemctl restart sshd
